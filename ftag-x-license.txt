Fatty Text Adventure Game (FTAG) is shared under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives (by-nc-nd) License. While FTAG-X is a tool to allow modifying the game, it does not include any code or assets from FTAG. After conversation with FTAG's developer, Russ, it is mutually believed in good faith that FTAG-X is in compliance with the spirit of Russ's desires. However, FTAG-X's existence is contingent on Russ's goodwill, and should the permission granted to FTAG-X be revoked, I will be legally compelled to remove it from distribution. 

Modifications that utilize FTAG-X MUST NOT violate CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0, with respect to FTAG:

The code for FTAG-X is shared under Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike (CC-NC-SA) 4.0:

The TL;DR of all this is:
- Don't use FTAG-X to make money.
- Don't use FTAG's assets or source code in your FTAG-X mods, as this is in violation of FTAG's license. In excess of caution, this includes code generated by Tweego from FTAG's game file.
- You may duplicate (download, fork, etc.) FTAG-X to develop or redistribute it, as long as its license terms are obeyed.

We hope that FTAG-X makes it possible to create the FTAG mod you desire without needing to violate these terms.

Also, FTAG-X packages Tweego, which is distributed under the BSD 2-Clause license, included in LICENSE.txt in the tweego folder.
